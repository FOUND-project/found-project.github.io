Since the ‘war on drugs' was declared in 2007, disappearances related to drug cartel violence has been one of the most critical issues in Mexico. There are currently 114,000 individuals reported missing and the impact on their families is enormous. Lucía de los Angeles Díaz comes from one of these families. She has founded a mothers' collective - Solecito de Veracruz - to search for their loved ones. So far, they have been able to return the remains of over 300 disappeared to their families.

The approach we are using has the potential to improve search protocols for unmarked graves worldwide. While our methodology is effective in finding and analysing search areas using satellite imagery, the integration of drones, sensors, and multispectral cameras has allowed us to establish an evidence-based, cost-effective, and replicable approach. We have already successfully located unmarked graves in Mexico, and we have now developed the first protocol in partnership with a local government.
