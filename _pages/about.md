Since the ‘war on drugs' was declared in 2007, disappearances related to drug cartel violence has been one of the most critical issues in Mexico. There are currently 114,000 individuals reported missing and the impact on their families is enormous. Lucía de los Angeles Díaz comes from one of these families. She has founded a mothers' collective - Solecito de Veracruz - to search for their loved ones. So far, they have been able to return the remains of over 300 disappeared to their families.
