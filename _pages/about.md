## The Role of Searching Mothers Collectives
Madres buscadoras (searching mothers) draw on their deep knowledge to identify potential clandestine graves—sites where the remains of their disappeared loved ones might be located. In open areas, for example, they look for natural indicators—known as signs—such as off-season green plants or unusually blooming flowers, which may suggest the presence of buried bodies releasing additional nutrients into the soil. They insert a T-shaped metal stake into the ground and smell it upon removal to detect any scent of decomposition. If detected, they proceed to recover the remains.

In other settings, like abandoned houses, these mothers tap the cement floor with the same metal stake – known as a 'vidente' (seer or clairvoyant) – listening for changes in sound that could indicate an anomaly, such as a hollow space, and potentially, a body.

Since the ‘War on Drugs' was declared in 2006, disappearances have been one of the most critical issues in Mexico. Over 120,000 individuals are currently reported as disappeared, and the consequences for their families are beyond measure. 

## About the FOUND Project
Through FOUND, we leverage technology to collaborate with mothers in their search for disappeared sons and daughters, working together to bring a form of closure.

The FOUND project is focused on exploring the use of advanced technologies to identify clandestine graves in Mexico. The project involves tools such as hyper and multispectral cameras, LiDAR, seismic noise sensors, and conductivity meters to locate hidden graves. In response to the recent discovery of a *[clandestine crematorium](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly8gv7j5gyo)*, which has given increased national attention to the issue of missing persons linked to cartel violence, the team is investigating how satellite data can be used to detect crematorium sites in Mexico, based on ash evidence, with promising early results.

Launched in 2023, the FOUND project (Interpretar la Naturaleza para Encontrar a Quienes nos Faltan) combines the expertise of searching mothers’ collectives with advanced technologies to address Mexico’s crisis of disappearances. Based in Jalisco—the state with the highest number of recorded disappearances (over 16,000)—FOUND has established experimental sites that replicate clandestine burial scenarios common in the region. These sites use donated pig carcasses as proxies for human remains, allowing researchers to test technologies and study patterns of decomposition and environmental indicators.

FOUND is testing a range of methods informed by the knowledge of local mothers, including:
- Forensic Entomology and Botany, Territorial Analysis, Soil Studies.
- **Multispectral Imaging**
- **Hyperspectral Imaging**
- **Lasers, Airborne LiDAR**
- **Seismic Noise Interferometry Tomography (TIRSA)**
- **Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Conductivimeter**
- **Satellite Data & Spectral Indices**

As a result of the project, the Jalisco Search Commission has incorporated drones, multispectral cameras, and a laser scanner into its official search practices. Further instruments are scheduled to be acquired in 2026 with public funding. Knowledge exchange is under way with forensic teams and search units from Colombia, Uruguay, and the United Kingdom.

FOUND is currently funded by the *[FCDO Frontier Tech Hub](https://www.frontiertechhub.org/pilot-portfolio/found-technologies-to-locate-clandestine-graves)*.

## The Book

The book *‘Interpreting Nature to Locate Those We Are Missing’* (*Interpretar la Naturaleza para Encontrar a Quienes nos Faltan*) presents findings on the application of biological, physical, and earth sciences in detecting clandestine graves. 
The book is currently being translated into English.
